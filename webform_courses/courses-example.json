What do we learn about local politics from looking at the art and writing on a city\u2019s public spaces? Teams of students in both cities will conduct field work in selected neighborhoods to help create an archive of murals, graffiti, performances, and installations. Then, drawing from readings in history, art criticism, and urban studies, as well as from census and electoral data and using GIS technology, we will analyze how social and political processes like gentrification, inequality, and planning generate and reflect creative political expression as captured in our database, culminating in transnational, collaborative projects that explore what the art and writing of city streets reveals about urban life in 21st century America.","days":"","days2":"","notes":""},

What role did language play in the changes wrought by early capitalist transformations and the colonial expansion? Conversely, how have these global changes affected localized communities and the languages that identify them? And why should we care? To answer these questions we examine how the colonial experience has given rise to value-laden linguistic practices that mirror and sustain the racializing of privilege; and how the experience of language-loss encountered by voluntary and involuntary migrants can attack the integrity of the self. While ultimately concerned with language, our discussions have a wide scope ranging from issues of political economy to collective consciousness and individual psychology.

Is capitalism supportive or detrimental to democratic virtues? Does the welfare state rectify the problems of capitalism or exacerbate them? John Rawls\u2019 work  <em>A Theory of Justice<\/em>  has greatly shaped these considerations of the welfare state. His theory refined many of the debates concerning the fairness of capitalist economic outcomes and the effects capital accumulation has on democratic virtues.

But, critics of Rawls have called into question welfare state interventions, many finding them economically inefficient and detrimental to democratic virtues.

Through a range of disciplines and media this course considers the body as an aspect of not only medical and scientific exploration, but crucially as a vital element of culture and society. Bodies affect the ways in which the social world and power relations are organized, and they even arguably condition the way that we understand reality itself. Our physical form is constantly shaped according to both philosophies and fashions. Body ideals and broader ideals often interrelate strongly through bodily practices and with what we wear. There are meanings and fashions in all bodily forms (skinny, buxom, muscular, ideas of \u2018whiteness\u2019) and body practices (dieting, hair management, cleansing rituals, plastic surgery and genital cutting). Over the sessions, we will take a conceptual approach to fashion, as a strident condition of modern life, that incorporates politics, science and aesthetics and we will closely read a number of cultural texts against a number of theoretical models. Attitudes towards the body can vary widely according to historical period, and this course will explore how, in different moments, and via different media, we have been preoccupied with the aesthetics of different body zones, with displaying identity (gender, class and ethnicity), and also with power.

What are the opportunities and challenges to establishing a common moral framework for addressing bioethical concerns worldwide? Are cultural and geographic variations of ethical concerns and means for addressing them inevitable and perhaps appropriate? We will explore the historical context, principles and practices of bioethics and global health, as well as their interrelationships. Other issues that we will discuss in this seminar include the social determinants of health, human rights, research ethics, HIV/AIDS, ethical issues at the end of life, and emergency/disaster relief. Throughout the course we will utilize case studies to compare and contrast bioethical dilemmas locally, nationally and internationally. Students will learn and apply a stepwise approach for conducting ethical analysis. Class activities will include simulated clinical bioethics committees, research ethics review committees as well as policy analysis and recommendations. Course readings will include scholarly articles and chapters from the medical and social science literature such as public health, political science and philosophy.

How might the Baroque period be considered a living tension between  <em>Ambiguity<\/em> , a quality we associate more closely with the Renaissance, and  <em>Hyperbole<\/em> , understood here as excessive dogmatism?

This seminar introduces students to the work of Walter Benjamin, who is both a central figure in critical theory and an early, powerful commentator on the politics and aesthetics of trash. We begin with Agnès Varda\u2019s film The Gleaners and I, and explore the relation between theory and the recycling of ideas, images, and objects, especially those that have been overlooked or abandoned. As a refugee himself, Benjamin knew intimately how whole populations can be dispossessed or cast off. Following his thought, we ask what displaced subjects and discarded objects might teach us about the larger economies of capitalism, modernity and the city, but also about human desire, need and frailty. Our primary text is Benjamin's expansive and unfinished work of citations and brief commentaries, The Arcades Project (1927-1940), but we will read Freud, Marx, and the Frankfurt School to contextualize the work historically and theoretically. What did Benjamin make of dross, and what can we glean from his thought for our own times?\n\n\n\n","days":"Wed","times":"12:30 PM - 3:15 PM","days2":"","instructors":[{"A.B.

Mid-twentieth century urban renewal in U.S. cities brought bulldozers and tower-in-the-park housing developments to dozens of poor neighborhoods considered ripe for revision. Early-twenty-first century gentrification, meanwhile, has brought high-end commerce and affluence to areas once occupied by low-income and working class communities. In the Melrose section of the South Bronx, a series of changes have influenced the streetscapes and lives of residents. Rampant arson in the 1970s and 1980s destroyed acres of the neighborhood, for example, while migrants from Puerto Rico and immigrants from the Dominican Republic, West Africa, and Bangladesh, among others, settled in the remaining homes of Melrose to build new lives in a new city. Most recently, federal dollars have been earmarked for Melrose\u2019s reconstruction and redevelopment. This course, offered in partnership with the Bronx-based community empowerment organization WHEDCo, invites students to become activist historians whose objective is to learn what histories are at risk of being silenced or displaced as the South Bronx changes. Students will conduct archival and secondary research; produce collaborative oral histories with neighborhood residents and business owners; and meet with activists who are working to protect the interests of the current community of Melrose.

Our goal is to better understand how culture is \u201cmade\u201d \u200bprecisely \u200bduring \u200bthese \u200bmoments of charged debate, where a particular music\u2019s perceived merits\u200b or transgressions serve as the pretext for larger \u200boften controversial ideological issues. Art, in this sense, becomes a platform by which to observe how competing aesthetic value\u200b systems\u200b reveal deep social and cultural rifts. This class meets twice a week. Our first session is devoted to scrutinizing and discussing primary sources\u200b:\u200b letters, newspaper and magazine articles, journal entries, sound recordings, and film. For our second session we read and discuss secondary sources by scholars, critics, and investigative journalists for context, using this new information as a way to think critically about the primary sources and our own aesthetic judgments. Debating music tradition and innovation, as we shall see, is a long-standing tradition in its own right. \n\n","days":"Mon Wed","times":"11:00 AM - 12:15 PM","days2":"","instructors":[{"Kwami Coleman":"/content/gallatin/en/people/faculty/ktc4"}],"notes":""},

Questions of sexuality are central to the public debate on the Middle East. Scholars, politicians and journalists are engaged intensively with issues such as Islamic laws of modesty, persecution of LGBT Arab countries, and the separation of men and women within religious communities in Israel. To comprehend these questions, one must understand the sociological and cultural characteristics of contemporary Middle Eastern communities, but also the historical development of sexual attitudes in this area. In the present era, the Middle East is seen as a space of sexual repression and even \"Sexual misery.\" However, this was not always the case. Since the late 18th century, European powers tightened their military, political and economic grip of the East \u2013 from Egypt to India. Europe has established its superiority over \"The Orient\" through the representation of this diverse territory as backward, fanatical and religious. But simultaneously, the East was an object of desire, including sexual desire. European travelers, scholars and intellectuals characterized the Orient as a space of unlimited sexual freedom. Ironically, while in the past, the West condemned the Muslim world\u2019s alleged sexual licentiousness, the modern West today criticizes the Muslim repression of sexual freedoms. The course will tackle those questions from a historical perspective. Applying methodologies of queer theory, it will discuss the complex history of sexuality in the Middle East and sketch the genealogy of Western attitudes towards both Arab and Jewish sexuality, with a focus on LGBTQ. Relying on theorists and historians like Michel Foucault, Khaled El-Rouayheb, Samar Habib, and Joseph Massad, we will explore the essential role that sexuality in general, and the queer issue in particular, plays in the contemporary politics of the region.

Positioned simultaneously as a backlash against feminism, a testament to achieved gender equality, as a reclamation of traditional feminine values and a sign of female success, postfeminism\u2019s significance is widely felt even as its specific meanings and cultural effects appear unclear. This class will examine postfeminism\u2019s relationship to feminism and femininity, situating all three as historically and culturally significant manifestations of the female self. Closely linked to the development of neoliberalism with its emphasis on self-reliance, choice and privatization, postfeminism is largely a product of consumer culture and mass media that have particularly consequences for feminine identities and gender relations. This course will look at popular women\u2019s media from the makeover show, to fashion magazines and blogs, chick films and television drama to explore how they manage tradition and promote a more privatized and commercial feminine self, negotiating the relationship between family responsibilities and more laissez faire ideas of female success and self-actualization. \n\n\n\n","days":"Fri","times":"11:00 AM - 1:45 PM","days2":"","instructors":[{"Moya Luckett":"/content/gallatin/en/people/faculty/ml122"}],"notes":""},

Yet how true are these claims? And how new are the phenomena these claims describe? Scholars have pointed to the middle of the sixteenth century as the moment when the economy became global, and the age of exploration and colonization began to connect many parts of the world to each other in a complex network that included and radically reimagined forms of cooperation, piracy, and slavery. This course will explore what kinds of global consciousness developed in the early modern period in negotiations with these transformations. Some of our central questions include: to what extent did early modern people begin to imagine and experience the world globally, that is, as an entity whose regions were interdependent? Which groups of people began to experience it globally? How were things, places, and persons, not seen before categorized or valued? What influence did global encounters have on ideas about gender, sexuality, class, religion, and citizenship and on social and economic practices? What new kinds of narratives about the world developed in relation to the challenges of participating in it? Finally, to what extent is globalization a \u201cwestern\u201d phenomenon or a sign of modernity? We will investigate a wide variety of primary works, including travel narratives, plays, poems, ethnography, film, engravings, and globes. We will also read secondary works by literary scholars, anthropologists, and historians of labor, the economy, and science. Many of these works also put the past and present in conversation with each other in compelling ways. While many of the primary works originate in \u201cEurope\u201d or the Americas, we will also study a range of works that challenge the Eurocentric view of globalization that was emerging and still dominates much of contemporary discourse of globalization.\n\n","days":"Tue","times":"6:20 PM - 9:00 PM","days2":"","instructors":[{"Valerie Forman":"/content/gallatin/en/people/faculty/vf20"}],"notes":"Same as SCA-UA 721 006."},

This course has two principal aims: first, to help us to develop skills in the reading of lyric poetry, and, second, to consider the complex relation between lyric poetry and the actual world. In the first half of the class, we will study the forms and conventions of lyric poetry and work on developing our poetic sensibilities. In the second half, we will focus our attention on the relationship of modern poets to the concrete or actual world and focus our study on W.H. Auden and Wallace Stevens, two poets who address the pressing questions of their day, and the world they shared, in strikingly different ways. Yet, however different their approaches, both poets ponder questions of faith and secularity, consider heroism and loss in a century marked by war, and probe our human relationship to nature in answer to an increasingly industrialized and technological world. Readings will include texts that consider how to read lyric poetry (Hirsch, Vendler, Perloff), a representative selection of modern lyric poetry (Eliot, Pound, Valéry, Éluard, Apollinaire, Moore, H.D., Bishop, Hughes, Brooks, Rich), the works of Auden and Stevens (essays and poems), as well as the philosophical, historical and political narratives to which they refer and that inform their work (Freud, Nietzsche, William James, Santayana).\n\n","days":"Tue Thu","times":"3:30 PM - 4:45 PM","days2":"","instructors":[{"Lisa Goldfarb":"/content/gallatin/en/people/faculty/lg3"}],"notes":""},

Often labeled \u201cindescribable,\u201d the sublime has been debated for centuries amongst writers, poets, artists, and philosophers. The concept goes back to classical Greece, but it became particularly important in eighteenth century Europe. At that time the sublime was applied in relation to the creative arts to describe aspects of nature that instill awe and wonder such as mountains, avalanches, waterfalls, stormy seas, or the infinite vault of the starry sky. In the wake of the French Revolution, the sublime for the Romantics became a quasi-secular route to cultural and aesthetic freedom through contact with the unbounded and the supersensible. In our contemporary world, where culture and gender difference, psychoanalysis, postmodern theory, technology, neuroscience, and neoliberal spectacle seem to eclipse former concepts of nature and transcendent experience, the characteristics of the sublime are perhaps more fuzzy than ever. The term and the debates however remain very much alive and relevant to contemporary aesthetic, metaphysical, and ethical concerns.

The constitutional ideal that our government \"shall make no law\" abridging free speech has given way, in fact, to laws that limit discussion, ostensibly for the public good. Likewise, new media technologies advance our ability to access and exchange ideas and information, but raise new questions as to the limits of such dialogue. This course, then, addresses the delicate balance between free speech and democracy, guided by seminal readings from Milton, Locke, Meikeljohn, among others, as well as important Supreme Court decisions that have critically shaped First Amendment rights in regard to hate speech, pornography, corporate control of mass media, the student press and the rights of journalists. The course also takes a case-study approach to issues related to free speech in wartime and political crisis, a tension made evident in recent debates over privacy rights and national security. With this foundation, we ask: Are there any forms of free speech that should be restricted? If so, which? And, who should decide? \n\n\n\n","days":"Wed","times":"6:20 PM - 9:00 PM","days2":"","instructors":[{"Paul Thaler":"/content/gallatin/en/people/faculty/pet1"}],"notes":""},

Germany\u2019s profound influence on Modern European history and culture is felt nowhere as visibly as in Berlin. This interdisciplinary course analyzes the city\u2019s contributions to culture\u2013\u2013in literature, memoir, music, film and painting\u2013\u2013and its politics in the wider context of European trends. The course provides a comprehensive survey of Modern Berlin history and examines how artists reflected on those changing times. Special topics include: Christopher Isherwood\u2019s fictionalized memoirs during the Weimar Years, the Nazi Aesthetic during the Berlin 1936 Olympics as constructed by filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl, the photo-realist reflections of painter Gerhard Richter on terrorism in Berlin in the 1970s, and Germany\u2019s literary reassessment of guilt and victimhood following reunification. Readings and lectures are supplemented with walking tours of Berlin and its museums, to look at traces of historical, social and cultural change in situ; how memory, history and place interact over time in specific locations.","days":"","days2":"","notes":""},

Where does the \u201cMiddle East\u201d end and Africa begin? This course will explore how Arabic-speaking and African-descended peoples have engaged one another and the overlapping configurations of blackness and Arabness that have long circulated in the African Diaspora. Though \u201cArabs\u201d are popularly imagined in the West through long-held Orientalist stereotypes of the exotic, brown, and uncivilized \u201cother,\u201d many Africans and African Americans were inspired by the Arab anti-colonial culture and politics they encountered during the World Wars. Similarly, as Arabs sought to counter harmful colonial misrepresentations, they looked to the transnational, anti-racist philosophies and movements that African Americans and other African diasporic figures pioneered. These exchanges resulted in surprising moments of solidarity, like the Black Panther Party\u2019s first international chapter in Algeria, and the late Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser\u2019s funding of Malcolm X\u2019s travels through Africa. Through a historical and cultural survey of black and Arab thought through the twentieth and twenty-first centuries \u2013 a recent field of inquiry we will call \u201cAfro-Arab Studies\u201d \u2013 this class will examine the parallel and intersecting narratives of a range of significant Afro-Arab confluences, including but not limited to: négritude and pan-Arabism, the U.S. Civil Rights and Black Power movements and global anti-colonialism, cultural manifestations of the Non-Aligned and Pan-Africanist movements, and recent Black/Palestinian solidarity organizing. Readings will include narrative essays, political biography, historical monographs, and cultural theory by such writers, poets, and scholars as James Baldwin, Frantz Fanon, June Jordan, Alex Lubin, and Theri A.

Something more than novice, but less than expert, a tinkerer is one who tests boundaries and innovates through fresh perspective, often working outside of a professional context. Students in this class will learn the theoretical tools of feminist technoscience studies, noting how the topics of scientific research are guided by, and tacitly reinforce, sexist stereotypes and assumptions, and question whether it is possible to change the methods and the ideas that justify scientific knowledge itself. Along the way, students will become tinkerers in a literal sense by completing a robotic, wearable technology, or coding project of their own. Together, we will consider the radical potential of building from scratch in the digital age, the ethical imperative to re-write the world around us, and the philosophical experience of tinkering with knowledge itself. For in feminist critical theory, it is not enough to take things apart: we must also put them back together. No prior experience in building, coding, electronics or feminist theory required.\n\n","days":"Mon Wed","times":"11:00 AM - 12:15 PM","days2":"","instructors":[{"Cyd Cipolla":"/content/gallatin/en/people/faculty/cc176"}],"notes":""},

This course explores Ghana\u2019s development from the colonial era to the recent postcolonial period, providing an interdisciplinary history that is attentive to political economy, social relations, geography, and politics as they congeal throughout Ghana\u2019s development. Key historical moments will include the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the colonial era in light of their attendant reconfigurations of land, labor, and natural resources\u2014as well as landscapes of power and politics. In the postcolonial period, the course will examine the central epochs in the country\u2019s development trajectory in relation to its rich political history and shifting global discourses of development and geopolitics. This will include a focus on dynamics such as Asian investment, urbanization, international development aid, and the discovery of oil. The goal of the course is to explore theories and debates on development through deep engagement, using Ghana as a sort of intensive case study. Ghana\u2019s specific development trajectory will in turn be located alongside that of wider Africa and the global South, and alongside development debates and discourses whenever possible. Field trips will include visits to sites such as local gold mines and cocoa fields.","days":"","days2":"","notes":""},

Complex spaces that at once create, sustain, and transgress various forms of social and cultural distinction, cities pose particular challenges for the ethnographer in pursuit of fine-grained analysis that takes into account the multiple and transecting strands of the urban metropolis. In this course, we study various forms of ethnographic analysis in order to gain insight into the particularities of Paris and the broader historic, social, economic, and political phenomena that the city and its spatial organization reveal. Working out from an understanding of urban space as a socially and politically meaningful site of claims-making and contestation, we consider the importance of consumption and display in shaping urban identities, and of the shifting dynamics of groups and boundaries within the urban context. Alongside their investigation of the city, students also have an opportunity to develop their skills in ethnographic research methods. Exercises in participant-observation and and in the transformation of first-hand experience into a finished piece of ethnographic work allow students a chance to gain appreciation for the complexities of \u201cthe field\u201d while developing insight into a corner of Parisian life. Through critical reading of texts in urban anthropology and related fields, site visits in and around Paris, and methodology workshops wherein students explore the \u201cdoing\u201d of field research, the course allows students an opportunity to deepen their knowledge of Paris and of the complexity more broadly of city life. \n\n","days":"","days2":"","instructors":[{"Beth Epstein":"/content/gallatin/en/people/faculty/be9999"}],"notes":""},

We begin by reviewing classical and contemporary formulations of what democracy is, for what can be called liberal, deliberative, communitarian, and agonistic approaches entail very definitions of democracy, contrasting senses of its dangers and possibilities, as well as divergent visions of citizenship and public life, political culture and modernity. Then we consider these approaches in relation to the issue of  <em>difference:<\/em>  how do they explain and address the persistence of racialized and gendered forms of inequality in regimes committed to formal and legal equality? Why are formally democratic societies typically characterized by intense struggle over issues of identity and difference, not only race, gender, and sexuality, but also immigration? Our seminar concludes by exploring the relation between democratic regimes and empire, state violence, and national security: how does \"democracy\" become the name for a regime engaged in permanent war, torture, surveillance of citizens, and suspension of civil liberties? \n\n","days":"Fri","times":"11:00 AM - 1:45 PM","days2":"","instructors":[{"Rosanne Kennedy":"/content/gallatin/en/people/faculty/rtk1"}],"notes":""},

The life and work of Martinican-born psychoanalyst and social philosopher Frantz Fanon is the central lens in which we will interrogate (neo)colonialism and citizen responses to the psycho-social world that imperial encounters made. By examining several key texts, including  <em>Wretched of the Earth<\/em>  (1961),  <em>Black Skin, White Masks (1952) <\/em> and  <em>A Dying Colonialism <\/em> (1965) and a number of films, this course poses a number of key questions: What does it mean to be human? What does wo/man want? In what ways does Fanon's discussion of existentialism, alienation or even the idea or the materiality of the veil prove relevant to current political and social tensions and movements in the United States and abroad? Is there a \"healing psychological force\" in revolutionary action?

We shall explore the sexual politics of fashion, its philosophical relationship to temporality (its relentless and impossible pursuit of the \u2018now\u2019), and its relationship to certain modernist art movements. Fashion, as opposed to traditional dress based on one\u2019s social class or occupation, is a fairly recent phenomenon. Historians place the beginning of fashion in the early fifteenth century, concurrent with the burgeoning wool and silk trades of Flanders and Italy. One result of the increased trade and travel of this era was a new, growing awareness of what people were wearing beyond one\u2019s own small community. A new desire was born: the wish to look like a figure in a picture, to imitate someone you might never have seen in person. The everyday act of dressing turned into a version of costuming the self, inhabiting a theatrical role, based on an imagined relationship to an image. Fashion, in other words, finds its roots in performance. This performance now plays out on a global stage and has become a multi-billion- dollar industry, raising a host of aesthetic, philosophical, and political questions: Can one opt out of this performance? For whom is fashion performed? How do we experience the duality or split implied by the daily creation of a \u2018fashioned self\u2019? \n\n\n\n","days":"Tue","times":"6:20 PM - 9:00 PM","days2":"","instructors":[{"Rhonda Garelick":"/content/gallatin/en/people/faculty/rg9999"}],"notes":"Section 1 reserved for students who have completed a Practicum in Fashion Business.
